# Create a responsive “I’m interested” site



## Start page:

    The site should contain three products “Product Alpha”, “Product Beta”, and “Product Zeta”
    Customer selects product that they are interested in
    Button to take the customer to the next screen



## Customer information page:

    A form asking the customer about contact information
        Name
        Email
        Address
        Time and date picker
    Button for “Confirm”

## Confirmation page:

    Confirm that the information is registered and that we will contact the customer

## You can solve this how you want, however customer will consider the following:

    Use of good front-end principles for user interface
    Responsiveness of the design
    Use of modern front-end frameworks, such as React, angular, etc.
